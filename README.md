# Azure Multi-Tier Web Deployment
### Overview

This is my personal end-to-end documentation of delpoying a live Website on the Azure infrastructure along with APIs and Database. You can follow along this guide and build you own Website or Web-Server, as these documents include screenshots of each step and detailed explanation on how things are working. 

**If you are preparing for AZ-104 or DP-900, I highly recommend you to read it because this project was part of my preperation for AZ-104. It covers various concepts of Azure.**

**Before you begin with practical hands-on, Read the Basic-Concepts.md which covers the necessay theoretical part of this Project.**

### Overall Experience

It was a good experience since I got hands-on practice for the deployment of a Web-Server while intergrating it with the use of API which fetches and writes data to the Database Server. I stumbled upon plently of errors and made mistakes while doing this project and I believe that is exactly where the real learning happens. 

**You always learn from mistakes. Perfection is a fool's dream.**
